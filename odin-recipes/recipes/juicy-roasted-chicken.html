    <p>This is a great recipe for a whole roasted chicken that is juicy and tender. It takes a little bit of time, but it's worth it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup margarine, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse chicken, and pat dry. Season chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place chicken in a roasting pan. Place margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the remaining margarine into 1 tablespoon pieces, and place around the chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
